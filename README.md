AI MECHANIC FOR BIKES

A Full-Stack AI Application that bridges the gap between Technical Diagnostics and Financial Strategy.

📖 Overview

The AI Service Advisor is a smart kiosk designed for modern motorcycle repair shops. It solves a critical industry problem: The Trust Gap between mechanics and customers.

Instead of relying on guesswork, this system uses a Dual-Engine AI Architecture:

The Mechanic Brain: Diagnoses vehicle health using real-time sensor data (Voltage, Temp, Vibration).

The Banker Brain: Analyzes the customer's financial profile to check repair affordability.

The result is a data-driven Strategic Health Report that tells the customer not just what is broken, but how they should pay for it (e.g., Cash, EMI, or "Do Not Repair").

🚀 Key Features

⚡ Real-Time Diagnostics: Instantly flags critical failures (e.g., Battery Voltage < 12V, Overheating > 110°C).

💰 Dynamic Costing: Automatically maps identified issues to estimated parts & labor costs.

🧠 Strategic Advice Engine: * Green Light: Repair is affordable (<5% of income).

Yellow Light: Advisory warning.

Red Light: Repair exceeds 30% of monthly income → Recommends EMI Plan.

📊 Dark Mode UI: A professional, workshop-ready dashboard built with HTML5/CSS3.

🏍️ Real-World Data: Dropdown menu populated with top 50 real bike models (Yamaha, Honda, RE) extracted from Kaggle datasets.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: Python 3, Flask

Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn (Random Forest Classifier, Linear Regression), Joblib

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Dark Theme), Jinja2 Templating

Datasets: Real-world data sourced from Kaggle.

⚙️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/AtharvBeDiff/AI-MECHANIC
cd AI-MECHANIC

2. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Initialize the AI Models

Before running the app, you must train the models and extract the bike data. Run the setup pipeline:

python clean_and_train.py


4. Run the Application

python app.py


Open your browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000

📊 How It Works (The Logic)

The system uses a Dual-Brain approach:

1. The Mechanic Brain (Random Forest)

Input: Sensor readings (Air Temp, Process Temp, RPM, Torque, Tool Wear).

Training Data: Trained on the Kaggle Predictive Maintenance Dataset (10,000+ samples).

Logic: Detects non-linear failure patterns (e.g., High Vibration + Loose Chain = Drive Failure).

2. The Banker Brain (Linear Regression)

Input: Customer Work Experience (Years).

Training Data: Trained on Salary_Data.csv.

Logic: Predicts monthly income to calculate the "Financial Impact Score" (Repair Cost / Income).

🔮 Future Scope

IoT Integration: Connect directly to the bike's OBD-II port for wireless data collection.

Computer Vision: Allow mechanics to upload a photo of a rusted chain for auto-detection using OpenCV.

Cloud Deployment: Host the application on AWS/Azure for multi-shop access.
